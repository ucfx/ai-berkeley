# Project 1 - Search

This is the first project of the AI Berkeley course, focusing on search algorithms in Pacman. I have implemented the solution for this project.

## :book: Project Overview

In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

For more details about this project, you can visit the [Berkeley AI Project 1](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp22/project1/) page.

## :sparkles: Implementing Search Algorithms

I have implemented the following search algorithms:

- Question 1 : Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search
- Question 2 : Breadth First Search
- Question 3 : Varying the Cost Function
- Question 4 : A\* search
- Question 5 : Finding All the Corners
- Question 6 : Corners Problem: Heuristic
- Question 7 : Eating All The Dots (optional extra credit; hard)
- Question 8 : Suboptimal Search

## :rotating_light: Testing

To test implementations, use the autograder by running

```
python autograder.py
```

**_This project requires Python 3.6.0._**
